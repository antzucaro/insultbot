This is a toy IRC bot that will insult people on demand. Written in Golang, it was something I did in the morning to keep myself awake. More commands might or might not be added in the future. 

The default insults.txt file is pretty sparse. The intent there is to allow you (and potentially, your group of friends) the ability to add insults appropriate to your tolerance level. This means you can go as sugar-coated or as vulgar as you'd like!

Run the bot with the following options:

- file: the text file to use (one insult per line)
- chan: the IRC channel in which the bot will operate as "InsultBot"

Enjoy! :D
